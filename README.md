# Simulation-of-a-2D-Gas-with-Lennard-Jones-Potential
Project applying the Verlet algorithm to simulate the dynamics and thermodynamics of a 2D Lennard-Jones gas with periodic boundary conditions.

Language: Fortran 90

◦ Reviewed the theory of the Verlet algorithm and the statistical mechanics of the gas.

◦ Simulated gas dynamics, obtaining temperature and velocity distributions, matching theoretical results.

◦ Verified energy conservation and its temperature dependence, consistent with theory.

◦ Observed deviations in velocity distribution for low particle numbers due to finite-size effects.

◦ Found a linear relationship between pressure and temperature, consistent with ideal gas behavior at low density.

◦ Simulated solid-liquid-gas transition dynamics, determined the critical temperature, exponent, particle distance fluctuations, and pair correlation function.

This is one of the two final projects of the course of Computational Physics in my BSc Physics at the University of Granada, Spain and, therefore, it is mainly in Spanish. 


The name of the files mean:

n = y : Number of particles simulated.

z x z : Dimensions of the 2D space with boundary conditions.
