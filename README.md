# Simulation-of-a-2D-Gas-with-Lennard-Jones-Potential
Project applying the Verlet algorithm to simulate the dynamics and thermodynamics of a 2D Lennard-Jones gas with Fortran.

◦ Reviewed the theory of the Verlet algorithm and the statistical mechanics of the gas.
◦ Simulated gas dynamics, obtaining temperature and velocity distributions, matching theoretical results.
◦ Verified energy conservation and its temperature dependence, consistent with theory.
◦ Observed deviations in velocity distribution for low particle numbers due to finite-size effects.
◦ Found a linear relationship between pressure and temperature, consistent with ideal gas behavior at low density.
◦ Simulated solid-liquid-gas transition dynamics, determined the critical temperature, exponent, particle distance fluctuations, and pair correlation function.
